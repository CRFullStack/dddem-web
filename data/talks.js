However, with dotnet core, things have changed, it's never been easier to implement effective visibility into how your application is performing in production.\n\nIn this session I will cover the fundamental differences between Metrics and Logs, and Events and look at where one is useful over the other.\n\nWe’ll look at some of the things Microsoft has done in dotnet core to make logging easier, and some of the third-party libraries and tools that aim to make it easier to navigate.\n\nWe’ll cover tools like Serilog and Log4Net, along with AppMetrics for capturing application information. We’ll then take a quick look at Grafana, and see how we can make some sense of that information.  Finally, we'll look at Honeycomb.io and how they're providing actionable insights for distributed systems using events, enabling testing in production.","level":"Introductory and overview","tags":["devops","observability","metrics","dashboarding"]},{"title":"Functional Programming with C#","description":"Functional Programming is becoming increasingly popular and relevant with each year that goes by.

Whilst containerising applications may be one solution, this has the overheads of managing container hosts and clusters, which can also become victims of configuration drift.\n\nWhat if every time you built your application, you provisioned a new server image from the ground up as a first-class citizen of your build process? Fully automated, fully version controlled, tested and immutable. Deploying your application becomes a straightforward process of launching a new server image and retiring the old server.\n\nThe immutable server pattern is a practical alternative to containerising applications. In this talk, we’ll look at the benefits of using immutable servers as part of an immutable infrastructure paradigm and look at a practical example of packaging a Rails application into an immutable server.\n\nWe’ll take this a step further and look at how an Immutable Server is an ideal candidate for running as an EC2 Spot Instance on AWS, saving you up to 90% of the on-demand costs.","level":"Intermediate","tags":["cloud","devops","software methodology/process","architecture"]},{"title":"Jump into SQL Server Query Performance","description":"You sometimes have to write SQL Server queries and you can get what you want out of the database but sometimes it's not as fast as you would like.\n\nIn this session we'll go through the start of checking the performance of your queries and look at quick wins when it comes to making those queries run faster.\n\nWe'll cover Execution Plans and Query Statistics to give you the tools to be able to make those queries faster.","level":"Introductory and overview","tags":["database performance"]},{"title":"Getting Started with Unity and AR/VR for the .NET Developer","description":"We all see the cool demos of how augmented and virtual reality are going to be the future of our interaction with devices, but it often feels like there’s a significant barrier to getting started in building these types of apps.\n \nThis session is here to help.

Or do you have a vague memory of once hearing about a mythical beast called 'formal specification languages', which would one day save the world?\n\nLet’s step back a bit.\n\nWhen is the best time to catch a design flaw? Clearly it’s during the design stage, before a line of code has been written. But in reality, all too often design flaws come to light late in the development lifecycle (and this is why any self-respecting team invests in first-rate QA practices). Worse still, design flaws can emerge when the system is in live operation. If you’re building control software for aeroplanes, self-driving cars or nuclear power plants, then a simple design flaw can have catastrophic consequences.\n\nLuckily, for most of us, lives don’t depend on us getting our code right first time. But livelihoods might. If you’re a startup, you’ve typically got one shot at capturing the imagination of your target customers. If your system has a design flaw that ruins their experience, chances are that’s your opportunity missed. And as more teams adopt microservices, for all the benefits of that architectural style, one of the downsides is that it is very hard for our brains to reason about the complex operational states of distributed, concurrent systems. Potential race conditions, deadlocks and cascading failures are hard to spot in system design, and equally hard to test for. How do we reduce the risk of introducing such flaws when the system consists of large numbers of interacting, independent services?\n\nGetting better at system specification is a problem for our whole profession, whether we’re building business applications or control systems for nuclear submarines. In this talk, I will give an introduction to a formal specification language called TLA+,  which has broken out of the Computer Science lab and is now being used for real world projects at Amazon, Microsoft… and at our little Nottingham-based startup. I’ll explain why formal specification matters, even for us non-eggheads working on everyday software problems.

But now we have a new problem, our data is distributed. What happens if I need one service needs to talk to another about a shared concept such as a product, a hotel room, or an order? Does every service need to have a list of all our users? Who knows what users have permissions to the entities within the micro service? What happens if my REST endpoint needs to include data from a graph that includes other services to make it responsive? And I am not breaking the boundary of my service when all of this data leaves my service boundary in response to a request?\n\nNaive request-based solutions result in chatty calls as each service engages with multiple other services to fulfil a request, or in large message payloads as services add all the data required to process a message to each message. Neither scale well.\n\nIn 2005, Pat Helland wrote a paper ‘Data on the Inside vs. Data on the Outside’ which answers the question by distinguishing between data a service owns and reference data that it can use. Martin Fowler named the resulting architectural style; Event Driven Collaboration. This style is significant because it shifts the pattern from request to receiver-driven flow control. \n\nIn this presentation we will explain how events help us integrate our service architectures.

What is it that makes a candidate stand out? What do I look for in their CV? What is it about how they approach the interview or the technical assessment that impresses me?

I look for a balanced mix of skills in every candidate, and I’m often much more impressed by the quiet one who has demonstrated great judgment, insight or a capacity to learn.
